### How to prepare the interview?

After watching this example [video](https://youtu.be/wwIysnVmAUg?t=1268) of
coding interview, I have learnt methods on how to structure my interview and
best practices to communicate with the interviewer.

The things to do are:

1. After the interviewer introduces the problem, **ask for clarifications**. It
   is important to have a complete understanding of the problem.

2. When we start thinking, **think out loud**, so that the interviewer can
   follow your thought process and interact with you more easily

3. **Talk everything through before writing code down**

4. **Test your solution** with an example that the interviewer can give. If
   he/she doesn't give an example to you, make one up

5. **Think about edge cases**
