## How to prepare the interview?

After watching this example [video](https://youtu.be/wwIysnVmAUg?t=1268) of coding interview, I have learnt methods on how to structure it and best practices to communicate with the interviewer.

The things to do are:
1. After the interviewer introduces the problem, **ask for clarifications**. It is important to have a complete understanding of the problem.

2. When we start thinking, **think out loud**, so that the interviewer can follow your follow your thought process and interact with you more easily

3. **Talk everything through before writing code down**

4. **Test your solution** with an example that the interviewer can give. If he/she doesn't give an example to you, make one up

5. **Think about edge cases**
